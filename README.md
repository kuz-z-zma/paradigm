# Paradigm

Paradigm is a responsive theme for Zenphoto CMS, based on the Bootstrap (version 3.3.5) framework. It’s optimised for SEO and works well on a variety of platforms, from desktops to laptops, tablets and mobile phones.

Theme uses logical document titles hierarchy, accessible to search engines tag pages, conditional meta title and description, microdata (schema.org), OpenGraph and Twitter cards. Social sharing buttons can be integrated with ShareThis, links to social profiles can be added to the footer.
Extra files include robots.txt and .htaccess.

Originally this theme was created and developed by Olivier Ffrench, but seems to be abandoned by the author. I’ve unsuccessfully tried to contact him with bug report in February 2023, and wrote again in June 2023 to ask for permission to release my update with fixes, so the theme can be used with Zenphoto 1.6 release.
Since I’ve updated this theme to fix usage of depreciated functions and added several new features, I’ve decided to make it available to others.

New additions include: more flexibility for displaying content.

version 1.4.1:

 - Added Image Number (within Album) to image Title and Description meta-tags, to combat identical Title and Description for images.
 - Added auto-generated text to Albums (without descriptions) and Tags pages Description meta-tags, to combat identical Title and Description for those pages.
 - Some code clean-up for usage with php 8.2 (thanks, fretzl)

# Paradigm

Paradigm is a responsive theme for Zenphoto CMS, based on the Bootstrap (version 3.3.5) framework. It’s optimised for SEO and works well on a variety of platforms, from desktops to laptops, tablets and mobile phones.

Theme uses logical document titles hierarchy, accessible to search engines tag pages, conditional meta title and description, microdata (schema.org), OpenGraph and Twitter cards. Social sharing buttons can be integrated with ShareThis, links to social profiles can be added to the footer.
Extra files include robots.txt and .htaccess.

Originally this theme was created and developed by Olivier Ffrench, but seems to be abandoned by the author. I’ve unsuccessfully tried to contact him with bug report in February 2023, and wrote again in June 2023 to ask for permission to release my update with fixes, so the theme can be used with Zenphoto 1.6 release.
Since I’ve updated this theme to fix usage of depreciated functions and added several new features, I’ve decided to make it available to others.

New additions include: more flexibility for displaying content.

version 1.4:

 - Added option to assign rel=”nofollow” to Tags links (works on every page, where they are displayed).
 - Added option to specify length to News Items on Homepage.
 - Added option to enable Album Descriptions on Homepage.
 - If Album Custom Data is present – it is shown in full, if it is not available, Album Description is used.
 - Added option to specify length of Album Descriptions on Homepage.
 - Fixed H1 on News Archive pages.
 - Added sorting parameters to Archive list.
 - Some code clean-up.
 - Changed theme preview.
